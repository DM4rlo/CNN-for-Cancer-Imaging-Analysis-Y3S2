Two CNN models were designed and compared in terms of their architecture and performance.
Model 1 consisted of multiple convolutional layers with dropout and pooling,
while Model 2 had a simpler architecture with fewer layers. 

Both models demonstrated strong performance, with Model 2 achieving slightly higher
accuracy on the test set. The evaluation metrics, including precision, recall,
and F1-score, provided insights into the modelsâ€™ classification capabilities.

The findings highlight the importance of optimized model architecture and
the potential of streamlined designs for accurate lung image classification,
contributing to the development of effective medical systems.
